# Oslo : My own personal D3D12 framework for computer graphics.

Oslo is a C++ framework I use for my personal graphics projects and proof of concepts.
Some things are missing, like model loading and texture compressing, because I feel like I wouldn't need them for each individual project, or it would drastically change depending on the projects need.

## Features

- Full D3D12 support (SM 6.6, Bindless, Raytracing, Mesh Shaders)
- ImGui
- PIX markers
- DXC shader compilation and custom shader format
- Windowing
- Logging
- Allocators
- Image loading using STB

## Planned

- Execute Indirect
- Video Queue
